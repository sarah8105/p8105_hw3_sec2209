## Problem 1

In this first problem, I explore the Instacart data. I create a plot of
the number of items ordered in each aisle, limiting to aisles with more
than 10,000 items ordered.

``` r
data("instacart")
```

Next, I create a table that displays the three most popular items in
each of the aisles of “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and
“packaged vegetables fruits”. The table displays the number of times
each item was ordered.

``` r
  instacart %>%
    filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
    group_by(aisle, product_name) %>%
    summarize(orders = n()) %>%
    arrange(aisle, desc(orders)) %>%
    top_n(n = 3) %>%
    knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'aisle' (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## Selecting by orders

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 | orders |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | -----: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |    499 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |    387 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |    336 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |     30 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |     28 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |     26 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          |   9784 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           |   5546 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           |   4966 |

In the final portion of problem 1, I create a table that shows the mean
hour of the day at which Pink Lady apples and coffee ice cream are
ordered on each day of the week.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  arrange(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = product_name,
    values_from = mean_hour
    ) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 1)
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

| order\_dow | Coffee Ice Cream | Pink Lady Apples |
| ---------: | ---------------: | ---------------: |
|          0 |             13.8 |             13.4 |
|          1 |             14.3 |             11.4 |
|          2 |             15.4 |             11.7 |
|          3 |             15.3 |             14.2 |
|          4 |             15.2 |             11.6 |
|          5 |             12.3 |             12.8 |
|          6 |             13.8 |             11.9 |

The Instacart data contain de-identified grocery orders for users of
this online grocery service, which partners with local stores like Whole
Foods and Fairway to deliver groceries within 2 hours of order. Each row
in the data set represents a product that has been ordered. The data
include variables about the order (such as date and time), the customer,
and about the products ordered (such as product name and
department/aisle where the product can be found).

The resulting data set contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns. There are a
total of 131209 orders, 131209 customers, and 39123 products represented
in these data. On average, customers have placed 1 orders and each order
contains 11 products.

There are 134 aisles represented in the data. Most items that are
ordered come from the fresh vegetables aisle, with 150609 items ordered.
The most popular item from the baking ingredients aisle was Light Brown
Sugar, the most population item from the dog food & care aisle was Snack
Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats, and the most population item
from the packaged vegetables & fruits aisle was Organic Baby Spinach.
Coffee ice cream tended to be ordered later in the day than pink lady
apples.

## Problem 2

In this code chunk, I load and tidy the accelerometer data. I use the
`clean_names()` function from the `janitor` package to clean the
variable names, create a weekday versus weekend variable, and encode
data with reasonable variable classes.

``` r
accel = 
  read_csv(
    "./Data/accel_data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "activity_count",
    values_to = "active",
    names_prefix = "activity_"
  ) %>%
  mutate(weekend = ifelse(day_id %in% c(3, 4), "Weekend", "Weekday"))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double(),
    ##   day = col_character()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

These data represent five weeks of accelerometer data collected on a 63
year-old Advanced Cardiac Care Center of Columbia University Medical
Center patient who has been diagnosed with the chronic conditions of
congestive heart failure and obesity. The resulting data set contains
50400 rows and 6 variables. This data set contains indicator variables
for the week number (`week`) and day of the week (`day`), a variable
`activity_count` that represents incremental one-minute measurement
interval of the accelerometer, a variable that represents the
accelerometer reading (`active`) and the `weekend` indicator that
defines whether it was a weekend or weekday.

In the next code chunk, I aggregate the activity totals for each day and
display the data in a table.

``` r
accel %>%
  group_by(week, day) %>%
  summarize(
    total_active = sum(active, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = week,
    values_from = total_active,
    names_prefix = "Week "
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 1)
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'week' (override with `.groups` argument)

| day       |   Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3 | Week 4 | Week 5 |
| :-------- | -------: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: |
| Friday    | 480542.6 | 568839 | 467420 | 154049 | 620860 |
| Monday    |  78828.1 | 295431 | 685910 | 409450 | 389080 |
| Saturday  | 376254.0 | 607175 | 382928 |   1440 |   1440 |
| Sunday    | 631105.0 | 422018 | 467052 | 260617 | 138421 |
| Thursday  | 355923.6 | 474048 | 371230 | 340291 | 549658 |
| Tuesday   | 307094.2 | 423245 | 381507 | 319568 | 367824 |
| Wednesday | 340115.0 | 440962 | 468869 | 434460 | 445366 |

From this table, there appears to be a bit of a decline in activity on
the weekends.

In the next code chunk, I create a single-panel plot that displays the
24-hour activity trends for each day, color-coded by day of the week.

``` r
ggplot(accel, aes(x = activity_count, y = active)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = day), alpha = .5) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula 'y ~ x'

## Problem 3

In this final problem, I explore the Instacart data. I create a plot of
the number of items ordered in each aisle, limiting to aisles with more
than 10,000 items ordered.

``` r
data("ny_noaa")
```
